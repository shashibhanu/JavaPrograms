     * Since the count() method returns a long,

     * and allow for handling large counts,

     * Using long for the return type ensures that the method can handle a wide range of counts without overflowing.

	/*
char is a primitive data type in Java.
Character is the corresponding wrapper class for char.
When we use mapToObj(c -> (char) c), we are converting int values (character codes) to Character objects. 
This conversion allows us to work with a Stream<Character> instead of a Stream<Integer>.

	/*why String.chars() Returns IntStream
Compatibility: When Java was originally designed, it used a 16-bit char type to represent characters because it was based on the Unicode standard, which initially had a 16-bit encoding (UCS-2). However, as Unicode expanded to include more characters, a 16-bit encoding became insufficient.
Backward Compatibility: To maintain backward compatibility with existing code, Java kept the char type as a 16-bit entity while introducing methods like String.chars() to work with code points beyond the char's range
